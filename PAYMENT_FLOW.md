# SOL-Based Listing Fee Flow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive SOL-based payment system for listing meme coins on the platform. The system uses environment configuration for all sensitive values and provides both client-side and server-side verification options.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Solana Configuration
VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta
VITE_SOLANA_DEV_WALLET=BhEEK2AM41BNpPoEKQYVB6sc2RXq5awTQPArUm7RwQMM
VITE_SOLANA_LISTING_FEE_SOL=0.25
VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=false
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=

# Supabase Configuration (existing)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Environment Variables Explained

- **VITE_SOLANA_NETWORK**: Solana network to use (`mainnet-beta`, `devnet`, `testnet`)
- **VITE_SOLANA_DEV_WALLET**: Wallet address to receive listing fees
- **VITE_SOLANA_LISTING_FEE_SOL**: Listing fee in SOL (e.g., `0.25` for 0.25 SOL)
- **VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS**: Set to `true` to skip payments for all users (development mode)
- **VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL**: Optional custom RPC endpoint (uses fallback if not set)

## Payment Flow

### 1. User Clicks "Launch Meme Coin"
- Wallet connection is verified
- User is prompted to unlock wallet if needed
- Listing form opens

### 2. User Fills Listing Information
- Required fields: Project Name, Ticker Symbol, Project Logo
- Optional fields: Description, Social links, Trust signals, etc.
- Form validation ensures data quality

### 3. Payment Confirmation
When user clicks "Launch Meme Coin":

#### For Dev Wallet or Bypass Enabled:
- Payment is skipped automatically
- Listing is created immediately
- Success message is shown

#### For Regular Users:
- Payment confirmation modal opens
- Shows listing details and fee amount
- Displays wallet balance and required amount
- User clicks "Pay X SOL" to proceed

### 4. Transaction Processing
- SOL is sent to the configured dev wallet
- Transaction is confirmed on-chain
- Listing is created in Supabase database
- Success notification is shown

## Key Features

### Client-Side Validation
- ✅ Wallet connection verification
- ✅ Wallet unlock status checking
- ✅ Balance validation before payment
- ✅ Transaction confirmation waiting
- ✅ Error handling with retry options
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback

### Environment-Based Configuration
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Configurable listing fee
- ✅ Configurable dev wallet
- ✅ Network selection
- ✅ Dev bypass option

### Payment Security
- ✅ Transaction verification
- ✅ Amount validation
- ✅ Recipient validation
- ✅ Confirmation waiting
- ✅ Error handling

```

## Usage Examples

### Development Mode (Skip Payments)
```bash
VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=true
```

### Production Mode
```bash
VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=false
VITE_SOLANA_LISTING_FEE_SOL=0.25
VITE_SOLANA_DEV_WALLET=your_treasury_wallet_address
```

### Custom RPC Endpoint
```bash
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://your-custom-rpc.com
```

## Server-Side Verification (Optional)

The `verificationService.ts` provides server-side transaction verification:

```typescript
import { verifyTransaction } from '@/services/verificationService';

// Verify a transaction
const result = await verifyTransaction(signature);
if (result.success) {
  // Transaction is valid, create listing
  console.log('Transaction verified:', result.transaction);
} else {
  // Transaction failed or invalid
  console.error('Verification failed:', result.error);
}
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- **Wallet not connected**: Prompts user to connect wallet
- **Wallet locked**: Prompts user to unlock wallet
- **Insufficient balance**: Shows balance and required amount
- **Transaction failed**: Shows error with retry option
- **Network issues**: Uses fallback RPC endpoints
- **User rejection**: Graceful handling of user cancellation

## Testing

### Test Dev Bypass
1. Set `VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=true`
2. Connect any wallet
3. Try to list a coin - should skip payment

### Test Dev Wallet
1. Set `VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=false`
2. Connect the configured dev wallet
3. Try to list a coin - should skip payment

### Test Regular Payment
1. Set `VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=false`
2. Connect a different wallet with SOL
3. Try to list a coin - should show payment modal

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive values are in environment variables
- No hardcoded wallet addresses or amounts
- Transaction verification on both client and server
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Balance validation before payment attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Wallet not connected"**: Ensure wallet is properly connected
2. **"Insufficient balance"**: Add SOL to wallet or reduce listing fee
3. **"Transaction failed"**: Check network connection and try again
4. **"Environment variable missing"**: Check `.env.local` file

### Debug Mode

Set `VITE_SOLANA_DEV_BYPASS=true` to skip payments during development.

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple payment methods (USDC, etc.)
- Tiered pricing based on listing features
- Payment history and analytics
- Automated refund system
- Multi-signature wallet support
